# Robotic Arm
For my project I have built a robotic arm. Where it was challenging in some parts, it was ultimately a useful project that I enjoyed building.

# Starter Project

My starter project is a useless machine that turns a switch off if it is turned on. I was able to learn the basics of soldering, as well and how circuits works. I also learned about flip switches and pressure switches, as they are the types of switched used in the machine. The soldering was hard for me at first, but I eventually got used to it.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone is to finish constructing the physical portion of the robotic arm. This is because this is the part of the robotic arm that will actually be doing what the robotic arm is meant to do. It is important to make sure that all the screws are on tightly, so that they do not fall off when the arm starts moving. It was hard to distinguish the screws from each other at the beginning, but I realized that they each have labels on their bags.
